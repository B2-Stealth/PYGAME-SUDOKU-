# PYGAME-SUDOKU-
Sudoku game in Pygame 1.9, code in Python 2.7

                                                                                  num-key based input.
The code prints out the solution on the terminal for reference.
All back buttons take you one step back. The reload takes you to the main menu.

NOTE - You have to have these files in the same directory, and python 2.7 and pygame 1.9 installed on your system.
